/**
Title: GSM based Remote Monitoring System
**/

###Features

- Completely wireless installation
- Using advanced and reliable wireless Communication technologies. No rewiring costs, and easy to install with minimal time for commissioning. No interference with existing wiring in the plant. Saves the cost & complications of wired Systems. 
- Cloud hosted infrastructure 
- No need to host data servers, can be accessed by any Internet enabled device including cell phones and tablets from anywhere.
- Minute to minute tracking of power consumption and costs involved (as per Electricity board tariff)
- High data availability (99.99% availability) coupled with strong RAID (Redundancy) infrastructure
- SMS/ Email alerts on critical situations – sudden peaks, drop in PF, motor loading/underloading etc. 
- Compare and analyze past and current data over multiple time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Tracking of power generation from grid, gensets and renewable, track ROI on green infrastructure, and real cost of backup generation. 
- Tracking consumption pattern during Peak hours, off-peak hours and night hours as per electricity board guidelines
- Benchmarking consuming devices against their known production output.
- Integration with any existing meters (namely Trinity, Conserv, Elmeasure) with RS485 communication port. 
- Customization to N no. of meters.
- User Interface: The best available in the market.
- Cost Effective Wireless technology available at low cost benefit 
- Customized reports: Customization of reports/MIS as per clients’ requirement
- Comprehensive analytics, customized charting and automated reporting 
  
###Limitation

In case of network connectivity failure, there could be delay in receiving data – However, no data would be lost as RMS comes with in-built memory, which stores the data during n/w failure and starts sending once n/w is established.

###Features

- Answers critical part of the question - 'How to lower electricity expenses'
- Accessibility through Internet to help in monitoring remotely (even while away from the site)
- Monitor and plan production shiﬅs to maximize savings
- Effectively track critical situations and take preventive measures to reduce Penalty charges and breakdowns
- Ease of use – no major training required
- Monitor consumption of multiple locations by centralized system. Consumption of 5-6 factories (locations) spread across the country can be monitored from a single location Our Aim is not only to monitor your energy consumption, but to bring savings for your organization by continuous data monitoring and relevant comparison/ changes by in depth study. This not only provides access to crucial data , but also force engineers to take remarkable decision by utilizing his many years experience.
