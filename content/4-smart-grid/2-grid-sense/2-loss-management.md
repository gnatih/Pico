Title: Loss Management
**/

T&amp;D losses and Theft is one of the biggest pain points of Indian Distribution companies. Grid Sense allows you to detect and correct theft by proactive tracking by:

- Obtaining information on commercial losses in real time rather than monthly on a GIS system, and thus result in proactive steps.
- Identifying losses at feeder and  transformer level right now
- Identifying areas and customers to target (Alerts) to vigilance team, based on predefined algorithms based on consumption pattern.

We believe theft is a human problem, rather than a technological one, and Grid Sense provides you with the tools to cure it. A couple  of targeted theft detection cased, would immediately create an environment of theft aversion in an area.
