Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is  the technology of establishing 2-way communication with the existing consumer and distribution transformer meters. Once the  sensor and control layer of Gridsense is laid out on the existing distribution infrastructure, AMI would allow the following functionalities to be carried out:

###Advanced Metering Infrastucture (AMI)

| **Automated Meter Reading** | **Remote Load Management** | **Time of day Tariff** | **Protective outage Management** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Eliminates the need for manual collections of readings | Connect/Disconnect customers from Grid sense server | Ability to have variable time of day tariff settings | Customized alerts (SMS/Emails) for electricity outages with area highlighted |
| No Inaccuracies; Lowest cost per reading; lower than installation of GSM Modems | Effective load management with increased granularity by switching off power to specific areas/customers instead of feeders | Ability to inform customers by SMS/Mail of changes in tariff | Can log outages in an area |
