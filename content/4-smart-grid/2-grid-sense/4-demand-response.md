Title: Demand Response
**/

Unscheduled peak power purchase is an extremely expensive affair for most power DISCOMs. Peak power purchases can be managed very effectively by Demand response - a process of engaging and incentivizing consumers to reduce their demand at peak times. 

Grid Sense provides distribution companies the power to manage peak demand through effective demand side management:

- Selective brownouts: Instead of performing blackouts to complete feeder, brownouts can be performed remotely using AMI functionalities in Distribution transformers/ Distribution Transformer circuits. This can done instead of switching off complete feeders. 
- Predefined demand side management: Selective feeders/transformers can be remotely managed from a centralized location
