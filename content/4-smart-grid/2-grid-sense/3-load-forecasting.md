**/

- In an era where drawing excess/less power results in great penalties, the difference between cheap and expensive power is performing effective load forecasting.
- Increasing accuracy of load forecasting by 2%  saves a leading Indian power distribution company 200 crores per year in UI charges
- Grid discipline in induced in Power distribution by the ABT regime. ABT requires power distribution companies to predict their load in 15 minutes intervals. 
- Grid sense performs load forecasting using the following techniques:
  - Extrapolation methods utilizing weather patterns  
  - Local conditions and variability taken into account (agricultural load, festivals, local customs and cultures etc.)
- System is self learning
- Effective load forecasting due to increased granularity of data acquisition at each feeder level based on GIS
