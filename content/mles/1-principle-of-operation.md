From the fundamental theory of transformers, it will be recalled that the voltage induced in a winding usually far exceeds the resistance drop in that winding. In other words, winding open-circuit reactance usually is much greater than winding d-c resistance. Further, it will be recalled that a relatively small amount of direct current flowing into the winding of a transformer, in the core of which there is no air gap, causes the core to saturate. Thus, the reactance of the transformer may be varied by a small amount of d-c power. Now, if one winding of a transformer is connected between an a-c supply and a load, the amount of power delivered to the load may be controlled by a small amount of d-c power flowing in another winding. Because of the fact that open-circuit reactance ordinarily exceeds d-c resistance, the possibility of power amplification is inherent in a transformer.

Also by using rectangular shaped B-H curve with cores equivalent to amorphous grade self losses can be minimized, so that when load is absent self losses are minimum.

In grain-oriented steel cores there is an approximately linear relationship between d-c ampere-turns per inch and a-c ampere-turns per inch over a large range of flux density. Moreover, the a-c NI/in. for a given d-c NI/in. change but little with a-c flux density over this range. In Fig. above each of the lines for a given value of control magnetizing force is nearly vertical. For a given value of control NI/in., load current is almost independent of flux density and therefore of a-c supply voltage. The sections following are based on the use of grain-oriented core steel.
