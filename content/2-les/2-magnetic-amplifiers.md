Magnetic amplifier is also called Mag-Amp, is in user for US, European and Russian navy and space application where reliability are results are more important. The Mag-Amp is an "magnetic field" kind of amplifier.

Visually a Mag-Amp device may resemble a transformer but the operation principle is quite different from a transformer essentially the mag amp is a saturable reactor. It makes use of magnetic saturation of the core, a non-linear property of a certain class of transfomer cores. For controlled saturation characteristic the magnetic amplifier employs core materials that have been designed to give specific B-H curve shape that is highly rectangular, in contrast to the slowly tapering B-H curve of softly saturating core materials that are oftern used in normal transformers.

The typical magnetic amplifier consists of two physically saperate but similar transformer magnetic cores, each of which has two windings - a control winding and AC winding. A small DC current from a low impedance sources is fed into the series -connected control windings. An AC voltage is fed into one AC winding, with the other AC winding connected to the load. The AC Windings is connected in series. The amount of control current fed into the control winding sets the point in the AC winding waveform at which either core will saturate. In saturation, the AC winding on the saturated core will go from a high impedance state ("OFF") into a very low impedence state ("ON") - that is, the control current controls at which voltage the MAG-Amp switches "ON".
