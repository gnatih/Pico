Our models conserve good chunk of energy and money as well for gas discharge lamps like tube light, sodium vapor lamp, mercury vapor lamp, metal halide lamps, CFL, gls etc without wiring change or without altering existing fittings. This is achieved by Power Tech Magnetic Amplifier coils or Economy model and is fitted before MLDB. Above certain level, performance of gas discharge lamp saturates and saving is achieved by limiting excess energy consumed by load which otherwise is wasted and we assume it as normal. 

Because of power limit, life of lighting device extends by almost twice, choke burning reduces and thus maintenance and hazards are minimized. This is based on principle that, above saturation region (plateau) even if more power is pumped into luminaries, it gets dissipated in form of heat thereby reducing its life. This saturation power is limited by means of adding reactance. This resists to abrupt change in current and absorbing momentary energy thus avoiding surge to load. These various design factors leads to energy saving as well as increase in life of lighting devices by almost twice. No doubt reduced current leads to lesser breakdowns and longer life of switchgears. 

To have an added maintenance free life, our coils are designed with 10 % extra safety margin and switchgears with upto 30 % extra margin. 

Power Tech Magnetic amplifier pioneer in technological application, which maintains rms power to lighting load constant thereby maintaining Steady Lumen condition with scene control. With its unique feature of flux induction energy saving and steady lumen without any moving parts or contactor, it is most preferred by technocrats and industrialists. This is all achieved by without any motor control and has got flux induction principle with closed loop system. Upto 30-40% saving is achievable.
