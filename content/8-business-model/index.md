Energy Conservation is considered to be an essential means to reduce cost of operation and thus enhance profit margin. In addition recently it has assumed a critical role of reducing rate of global warming by reducing fuel consumption resulting into reducing emission of Green House Gases.   An integrated and detailed approach and accurate planning can result in significant reduction in energy cost.  Power Tech makes use of unique technology to implement energy conservation in large organizations and industrial units in order to optimize power conservation.
